# Rulf 3D
Raycast FPS game engine with wgpu.

Mimic Wolfenstein 3D's raycast rendering with computing GPU and make the engine for creating game.

- [ ] Draw Triangle with direction.

## After...
- [ ] Make basic game logic(input, movement, collision, ...).
- [ ] Make playable only with minimap. (Complete 2D game)
- [ ] Make consistent calculation for f(distnace) -> depth.
- [ ] Compute raycast and render written depth 1d texture.
- [ ] Render written depth 2d texture.
- [ ] Render with wall texture.
- [ ] Add background.
- [ ] Add Sprite. Make static object.
